### Now

I live in San Francisco Bay Area. I'm an optical sensing hardware engineer at a secret company. I am in charge of defining a custom silicon for optical sensing. Please refer to my CV and LinkedIn page for more information.

### Past

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I received my M.S and B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea.

My research in graduate study was mixed-signal circuit design for image sensor applications. My works include time-of-flight camera, fluoresence lifetime imaging, wide dynamic range camera, low power image sensors and smart image sensors with mixed-signal image processing.

I was an instructor in Electrical Engineering at Korea Air Force Academy.
