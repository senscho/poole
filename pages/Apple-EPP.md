If you see this page, you are probably offered by me a discount on Apple products. Read this document carefully to minimize the process time.

## Price After 15% Discount

To calculate the final price you will pay, first visit [Apple.com](http://apple.com) and find out the final cost without the discount. This is in general base price + tax but there can be some additional charges too.

For example, if the product is <span>$</span>100 and the sales tax in your state is 9%, then your price will be $ 100 \times (1 + 0.09) $. Applying 15% discount means paying (100-15=85)% of the price. Consequently, the price you pay is $ 100 \times (1+0.09) \times 0.85 $.

The state sales tax rate is based in the place where your product is delivered or picked up.

## Send me Info for Order

Please go to [Apple.com](http://apple.com) and go through the purchase process. This is exactly what I will do on my computer at Apple's private network. Remember what you had to provide Apple during the ordering process, give me all of them.

The required infos are often 
* Model \[should be very specific including base model, color, capacity, options, any customization\]
* Pickup Info: name on ID card, pickup location \[address of the store\], phone number, email address
* Payment Info: card number, cvc, expiration date, billing contact \[name, address including zip code, email address, phone number\]

### Delivery

You can choose to receive delivery or to pick up the product at any Apple stores. When you select delivery option on the website, you will see the availabiltiy in real-time.

### Payment

You could either give me the full payment info or send me cash via venmo or chase. Note that online cash payment has daily limits.

## Order in Foreign Countries \[outside USA\]
You could order in Korea. You can use Korean credit card or American. If you use Korean credit card, you should provide the first two of PIN and your date of birth \[month, day and year\].
